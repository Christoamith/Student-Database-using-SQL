# Student-Database-using-SQL
Creating a student database involving new schema and joins
The project is about creating and retrieving data from a student base.
The database was created on MSSQL server.

- A new database named ‘LMT_University’ was created with a condition to check if the database already exists. If the database is already available then it is dropped and created again.
- A new schema was created instead of using the default schema ‘dbo’.
- Tables such as Student addresses, Departments, Lecturers, and Student information were created under the database using Create table query with respective datatypes for each variable, and values were inserted using the Insert query.
- Functions like CONCAT, COUNT, UPPER, SUBSTRINGS were used in the select query to retrieve necessary data.
-	WHERE clause was used to filter out the table and retrieve particular information.
-	Date functions such as DATEDIFF were used to calculate the age with respect to the current date(getdate()).
-	Inner Join and Left Join were used to retrieve data by combining two or more tables.
